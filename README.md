Analyze a company’s global asset exposure to physical climate risks using the VELO SDK, highlighting risk distribution through maps, sorted treemaps of high-risk regions, and comparative bar charts, enabling stakeholders to prioritize mitigation efforts for assets in vulnerable geographies.

## 2. **Company Asset Type Risk Across Years**

Retrieve and visualize a company’s climate metric scores for two specific asset types for two horizons. Use histograms to compare the distribution of exposures by asset type and line charts to illustrate how average exposures change over time.

## 3. **Assets Overlaid Map**

Retrieve a company’s asset-level climate metric scores, plot their locations, and colour code based on which climate risks are present.

## 4. **Market Benchmark**

[![Open in SageMaker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-SageMaker-orange)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/RiskThinking/cdt-express-notebooks/blob/main/4.market-benchmark.ipynb)

Compare a company against a market index to benchmark its exposure to climate risk over time. Visualize the most impactful risk factors for each entity to see which risk factors make up that exposure.

## 5. **Insurability**

Visualize the change in uninsurable and stranded assets for a company over time due to changes in climate risk exposure. Retrieve and display the most at-risk assets that are uninsurable or stranded.

## 6. **Company Asset Type Materiality vs. Risk**

Retrieve and compare a company's asset materiality score with climate metric scores. Visualize using histograms to compare distributions across the company and by asset type.
