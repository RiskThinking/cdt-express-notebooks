      "Some notebooks utilize paginated API endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently. For instance, when retrieving assets associated with a company, the API may return results in pages, each containing up to 100 assets. Therefore, the total number of API calls depends on the total number of assets (N) and the page size.",
